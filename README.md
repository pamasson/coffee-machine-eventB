The JeB plugin is in the file 'fr.loria.dedale.bsimu-0.6.6-SNAPSHOT.jar'. To install it, simply drop it into the 'dropins' directory of Rodin and relaunch it. An icon 'jeB' should appear in the toolbar. Clicking on it will generate for *all* open models the JeB animation files, inside directories called 'jeb'.
